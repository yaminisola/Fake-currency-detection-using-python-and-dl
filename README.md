Fake Currency Detection is a deep learning-based system that identifies counterfeit banknotes using transfer learning techniques. It processes currency images, extracts key features, and classifies them as genuine or fake using pre-trained CNN models like ResNet, Alexnet, MobileNet. The model achieves an accuracy of around 90-95%.
